This is fullstack softawre agency project. i have build this site in my leisure time only cool. that's why did'nt have much time added much functionalilty. but in future i will try add here more things. here i have implement context api for data handling. my plan was using redux or graphql using. but this is only testing project and i have time conflict that's why can't add that features. also love to add typeScript. right now my machine taking little time while compile typescript file, it's too hard me that using that site without typescript.
